# 1. AssetNameAndValuesExtractor.sh

This file contains the unix script for extracting the data from the link and stores the data in 
  tabular spaced format in the local file.

  For running the script on Windows OS (I have used Windows OS for executing the script) :
  Download and Install Cygwin 
  Open the terminal
  Navigate to the folder containing the script
  Run ./AssetNameAndValuesExtractor.sh in the terminal

And the data will be saved to the finaloutput.txt file on your machine.
